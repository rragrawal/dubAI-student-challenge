### Worked examples

#### Example image classification Google Colab Jupyter Notebook for classifying dogs and cats from images
https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1erRAEMIGNlAuZ-8rpfAyw1IUW2esqAUy#scrollTo=VfxO7uCbc8sE

Dataset required to run the Dogs vs Cats image classification

#### ChatGPT example prompts
Example ChatGPT prompts that can be used to generate code similar to the above. Note that ChatGPT can generate good quality code, but it may also contains that you may need to fix.

Prompt 1:
“Write Python code using Pytorch to train an image classification model for classifying cats and dogs. The model should learn to fine tune a ResNet50 model with pretrained weights from imagenet”

Prompt 2:
“Write the pytorch code to use this trained model to evaluate the model on validation data”

Prompt 3:
“Write pytorch code to show the output on a number of sample images”
